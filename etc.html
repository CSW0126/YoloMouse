        <div class="Section">
            0.10.0
            <li> new: "Games Only" option: prevents YM from working with non-game apps. enabled by default. this isnt perfect and may false positive, but goal is to just reduce unwanted assignments to untested/nongame apps.
            <li> new: can now resize any cursor, not just preset cursors.
            <li> removed: default cursors: this wasnt used much... probably because i shouldve better worded it as "make all cursors same as current one"? i can add again if requested enuf :)
            <li> fixed: original game cursors sometimes not restoring when closing YM
            <li> fixed: hourglass cursor being assigned when first alt-tabbing/loading some games like PoE and Overwatch

        <div class="Section">
            0.9.1
            <li> entire cursors are now hashed to increase hash accuracy. this will outdate some cursor bindings requiring them to be rebound again. thanks @Archomeda for this update.
